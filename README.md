## FibTest app in Swift.

This application demonstrates:
1. How to handle potentially large data sets using Core Data
2. How to architect & design your iOS app modularly so that different components can be reused in other projects.

### Instructions

1. Checkout the code,
2. Open the  project in Xcode,
3.  Build the app in Xcode
4. Use the app

### Todo List 
1. Read Code Challenge
2. Sketch out UI on paper
3. Init the project
4. setup the UI
5. Set up fibanocci
6. set up core data & fetch results controller
7. Save to core data 
8. Fetch from fetch results controller for first page  
9. Fetch results on 2nd page 
10. Complete unit test
11. Fix errors/Make improvements 

### Project design & decisions
1.  I use a ViewController Extension Centric design by breaking up the ViewController into multiple files and grouping the functionality. This has multiple benefits (I plan to create white paper on this), but the main one is clarity. I do this in my own apps, and have no problem not doing this in your company code. 
2. I have prefixed the ViewControllers  with VC. It's just my preference; however, this is NOT best practice, it's just my preference due to the project navigator/window size.
